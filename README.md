# GScript_YT_Data_API

Data Analytics for Youtube Channel can be very time consuming. I was suffering from the same problem few months back while trying my hands on automating Data Analytics at Covalent in the Data Alchemist BootCamp. During my time there, I came across a tool called Youtube Data API using which you can scrape Youtube Data in a matter of minutes. The API call worked on the Google Apps Script editor which was gs code (majorly javascript in reality). This repository shares my code for searching vidoes on youtube for a given genre & also extracting it's statistics( view count & likes/dislikes count majorly). 

# Setup Instructions :
* [Open Google Apps Script Platform](https://script.google.com/home/start)
* Add the Youtube Data API from the services section.
* Now copy paste the script into the editor.
* Open Spreadsheets & copy the spreadsheet ID in the script.
* Now, also input the search term you want the data for.
* Hit the Run Button....

  Boom, there you go! All of the data being scraped from Youtube and put into your Spreasheet.

  I hope it turns out to be beneficial for anyone looking to automate their process of youtube analytics.
